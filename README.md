# kinectbodytracking
An Unity application with Kinect plugin for motion capture.

## Building the project
This project was made with Unity3D version 5.3.1f1. I have not tried building it with other more recent versions of Unity, so your milage may vary. Older versions of Unity can be downloaded at [Unity's archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).

## Description
This project is built using Microsoft's plugin for Kinect v2. It was done to work with the [virtualtheatre](https://github.com/fvcaputo/virtualtheatre) project. This application can either send live data from a kinect to the application built from virtualtheatre, and the data will be displayed in AR. Or this application can be used to record the data in a format also read by virtualtheatre, so the app can display it as an animation.
